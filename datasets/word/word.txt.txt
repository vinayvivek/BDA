spectators, financial institutions, and thus ultimately the researchers. Data mining approaches, being the backbone,
several prediction schemes and analytics have been presented related to cricket. In this paper, we intend to present
a vivid review of several important data mining schemes specifically meant for analytics related to cricket matches
that are reported in the literature. The review is made in three distinct approaches based on the format of cricket
matches played around the world. These are the one-day matches, T-20 matches, and test matches. Finally,
comparative analysis have also been made and are presented separately for all the three formats among the
available schemes. Suitable discussion is presented at the end of the paper that may be utilized in the direction of
future works.A deeper analysis on the two different approaches have been illustrated individually in this section. The first
approach discusses about standard techniques reported so far which utilizes several machine learning schemes for their
algorithms to predict aspects like winner prediction, run time score predictions, team selection, fitness evaluation etc. The
second approach discusses about user defined heuristics and miscellaneous methods for the same purpose.
